# aeq Aggie Experts Query Tool

The idea of this project is to develop a library of common queries to the
Aggie Expert data, and libraries to support those queries.

The goal is to support select,describe, construct and update queries; allowing
parameter injection into query templates; and support a command-line interface
for those queries as well.

The queries will be stored in a linked data format, so that they can eventually
be moved to the server itself potentially.
